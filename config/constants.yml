study_type_questions:
- 1a. Does your study require a higher level of privacy for the participants?
- 1b. Does your study have a Certificate of Confidentiality?
- 1c. Do participants enrolled in your study require a second DEIDENTIFIED Medical
  Record that is not connected to their primary record in Epic?
- 2. Do you wish to receive a notification via Epic InBasket when your research participants
  are admitted to the hospital or ED?
- '3. Do you wish to remove the ''Research: Active'' indicator in the Patient Header
  for your study participants?'
- 4. Do you need to restrict the sending of study related results, such as laboratory
  and radiology results, to a participants MyChart?
study_type_questions_version_2:
- 1. Does your study have a Certificate of Confidentiality?*
- 2. Does your study require a higher level of privacy for the participants?*
- 2b. Do participants enrolled in your study require a second DEIDENTIFIED Medical
  Record that is not connected to their primary record in Epic?*
- 3. Do you wish to receive a notification via Epic InBasket when your research participants
  are admitted to the hospital or ED?*
- '4. Do you wish to remove the ''Research: Active'' indicator in the Patient Header
  for your study participants?*'
- 5. Do you need to restrict the sending of study related results, such as laboratory
  and radiology results, to a participants MyChart?*
study_type_questions_version_3:
- 1. Does your Informed Consent provide information to the participant specifically
  stating their study participation will be kept private from anyone outside the research
  team? (i.e. your study has a Certificate of Confidentiality or involves sensitive
  data collection which requires de-identification of the research participant in
  Epic.)
- 2. Does your study require a higher level of privacy protection for the participants?
  (Your study needs "break the glass" functionality in Epic because it is collection
  sensitive data, such as HIV/sexually transmitted disease, sexual practice/attitudes,
  illegal substance, etc., which needs higher privacy protection, yet not complete
  de-identification of the study participant.)
- 3. Is it appropriate for study team members to receive Epic InBasket notifications
  if research participants in this study are hospitalized or admitted to the Emergency
  Department?
- '4. Is it appropriate to display the pink "Research: Active" indicator in the Patient
  Header for all study participants?'
- 5. Is it appropriate for all study participants to receive associated test results,
  such as labs and/or imaging findings, via MyChart?
- 1. Does your Informed Consent provide information to the participant specifically
  stating their study participation will be kept private from anyone outside the research
  team? (i.e. your study has a Certificate of Confidentiality or involves sensitive
  data collection which requires de-identification of the research participant.)
- 2. Does your study require a higher level of privacy protection for the participants?
  (Your study needs "break the glass" functionality because it is collection sensitive
