# The default implementation is that the software specified in $pkg_source is
# downloaded, checksum-verified, and placed in $HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkgfilename,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/filename.tar.gz. You should
# override this behavior if you need to change how your binary source is
# downloaded, if you are not downloading any source code at all, or if your are
# cloning from git. If you do clone a repo from git, you must override
# do_verify() to return 0.
do_download() {

# The default implementation tries to verify the checksum specified in the plan
# against the computed checksum after downloading the source tarball to disk.
# If the specified checksum doesn't match the computed checksum, then an error
# and a message specifying the mismatch will be printed to stderr. You should
# not need to override this behavior unless your package does not download
# any files.
do_verify() {

# The default implementation removes the HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname folder
# in case there was a previously-built version of your package installed on
# disk. This ensures you start with a clean build environment.

# The default implementation extracts your tarball source file into
# HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH. The supported archives are: .tar, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz,
# .tar.xz, .rar, .zip, .Z, .7z. If the file archive could not be found or was
# not supported, then a message will be printed to stderr with additional
# information.

# environment variables have been set, so you can use this callback to perform
# any actions before the package starts building, such as exporting variables,
# adding symlinks, and so on.

# The default implementation is to update the prefix path for the configure
# script to use $pkg_prefix and then run make to compile the downloaded source.
# This means the script in the default implementation does

# if you have additional configuration changes to make or other software to
# build and install as part of building your package.

# environment variable exists and set to true, env DO_CHECK=true.

# The default implementation is to run make install on the source files and
# place the compiled binaries or libraries in HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/packagename-version/. It uses
# this location because of do_build() using the --prefix option when calling the
# configure script. You should override this behavior if you need to perform
# custom installation steps, such as copying files from HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH to
# specific directories in your package, or installing pre-built binaries into
# your package.

# how the binaries are stripped, which additional binaries located in
# subdirectories might also need to be stripped, or whether you do not want the
# binaries stripped at all.
